# Form Prefiller Plugin

Because of some good arguments expressed by pamtbaau on the Grav Forum about the dev branch of this plugin I have decided to go back to the drawing board. Keep an eye on the [discussion on the forum](https://discourse.getgrav.org/t/workaround-for-using-validate-required-on-form-file-fields/23532/1) if you're interested.
